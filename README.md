# SpaceX Falcon 9 Landing Prediction 
Project background and context
Space X Falcon 9 rocket launches cost 62 million dollars; other providers cost upwards of 165 million dollars. This is because Space X can reuse the first stage. If we can predict if the first stage will land, we can determine the cost of each launch. This information can be used if another company wants to bid against space X for a rocket launch. Launch success rate may depend on orbit type, payload mass, location and proximities of the launch site.

Problems you want to find answers to:
Determine the cost of each launch.
Predict if the first stage of the Falcon 9 rockets will be recovered and reused.
Determine the factors that influence the successful landing of launched Falcon 9 rocket.
